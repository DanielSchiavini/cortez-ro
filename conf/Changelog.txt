	  ban_spoof_namer is no more. [Skotlex]

	  [Skotlex]
	* Merged config setting 'attack_walk_delay' (battle.conf). Defaults to 0.
	  When set, it makes it so a character cannot move inmediately after
	  attacking, on Aegis the default is 0, but this leads to sprite desyncs
	  pretty easily; see conf file for more info. [Skotlex]
2006/08/31

	  specifically, it has been renamed to log_filter. Using both together you
	  can get more specific rules of which stuff to log (log_athena.conf)
